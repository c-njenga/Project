# KARAMOJA PROJECT

# ANALYZING THE FOOD INSECURITY IN KARAMOJA REGION

# BUSINESS PROBLEM

As a Data Analyst, I assessed the Karamoja food security crisis. Where the data contains the districts of the Karamoja Region and the 2 main food crops grown, I can monitor the food security and produce insights on how to improve the food security in the region.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

By creating an interactive visualization the stakeholders can monitor the food situation in the region and come up with solutions on the most effective way to curb food insecurity.

# OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY

To determine which crop has the highest productivity

To determine which densely populated areas should be given more focus

To determine which district had the highest crop yeild

To establish the relationship between area and, crop area and yield

# Data Collection and Preparation

The data used will be obtained from Dalberg Data Insights. Data preparation will include cleaning the data to ensure there is no missing data and no duplicates.


  # DATA CLEANING
  
looking for any missing values in our DataFrame and analyzing the best way to handle the missing values.

Ensuring data accuracy by making sure there are no duplicates.

Cleaning data by dropping columns that were not in use.



Dealing with missing values

The column NAME has the names of the missing district names by replacing the disappeared district name column I will solve the missing value problem. Since I can use District Name column as the location then I can drop the SubCounty Name column


Crop area per Ha has a moderately high positive correlation with the area. sorghum has a low negative correlation with area meaning that an increase in area causes a small decrease in sorghum yield. While in maize a unit change in Area causes an increase of maize yield by 0.05%
There is a moderate positive correlation between the 2 crop yields.

# CONCLUTION

From the analysis, it can be concluded that:

Kaabong district is the most densely populated district in the Karamoja region, it has a lower Crop area than Kotido but has the highest crop yield

Sorghum has the highest average productivity overall and has highest crop area.

Kaabong is the district with the highest crop yeild

There is weak positive correlation between crop area and yield.

# RECOMENDATIONS

Sorghum has the highest productivity and hence should be given more priority as it is more drought-resistant.

Kaabong as the most densely populated district should have more land allocated for crop production.

More production of drought-resistant crops could solve the food insecurity crisis.

There should be more investigation into which crops perform best in which district as maize performs better in Kaabong District.
